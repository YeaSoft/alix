Release Scope

This release introduces full support for Debian squeeze and Ubutnu 8.04 in
addition to the previous version based on Ubuntu 10.04.


What's New
----------
  * Feature: Debian squeeze based version
  * Feature: commandline switch dhcpdif-swap to swap functionality between
    eth0 and eth2
  * Fixed: dhcpdif-ip=dhcp is now working


Included Software
-----------------

In addition to the minimal system (ubuntu-minimal), the following additional
packagets are included in this version of alix-rescue:

 * Connectivity and Usability
   + ssh
   + dhcp3-server
   + lsof
   + nano
   + rsync
   + screen

 * Additional File Systems
   + nfs-common

 * File System and Volume Tools
   + parted

 * Installation and deployment tools
   + uic

At runtime the user is able to install additional software in the live
system by using the standard means of ubuntu:

	apt-get update
	apt-get install <package>

Issuing apt-get update is mandatory, since the live filesystem does not
contain any package source listing in order to save as much as possible
memory.

The following memory usage values have been determined approximatively one
minute after completion of the boot process based on the selected alix-rescue
