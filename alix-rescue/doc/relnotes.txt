 * Support for Debian Wheezy 7.0.0
 * UIC updated to version 0.15
 * Binaries updated as of 2013-04-07


Included Software
-----------------

In addition to the minimal system (ubuntu-minimal or equivalent for debian),
the following additional packages are included in this version of alix-rescue:

 * Connectivity and Usability
   + ssh
   + dhcp3-server
   + lsof
   + nano
   + rsync
   + screen

 * Additional File Systems
   + nfs-common

 * File System and Volume Tools
   + parted

   + uic

At runtime the user is able to install additional software in the live
system by using the standard means of ubuntu:

	apt-get update
	apt-get install <package>

Issuing apt-get update is mandatory, since the live filesystem does not
contain any package source listing in order to save as much as possible
memory.

------------

The following memory usage values have been determined approximatively one
minute after completion of the boot process based on the selected alix-rescue
